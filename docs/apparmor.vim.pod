=head1 NAME

apparmor.vim - vim syntax highlighting file for AppArmor profiles

=head1 SYNOPSIS

The SUSE vim package is configured to automatically use syntax
highlighting for AppArmor policies stored in /etc/apparmor.d/ and the
extra policies stored in /etc/apparmor/profiles/extras/. If you wish to
use the syntax highlighting in a specific vim session, you may run:

 :syntax on
 :setf apparmor

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<apparmor.vim> provides syntax highlighting rules for the vim(1) text
editor; the rules provide an easy visual method to inspect AppArmor
profiles for syntax correctness and semantics.

The colors indicate the relative severity of granting a specific set of
privileges. Ranking access with colors is necessarily generic and vague,
but it may help you understand your profiles better.

=head1 BUGS

B<apparmor.vim> does not properly detect dark versus light backgrounds.
Patches accepted. If you find any bugs, please report them to bugzilla
at L<http://bugzilla.novell.com>.
