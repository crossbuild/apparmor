=head1 NAME

unconfined - output a list of processes with tcp or udp ports that do
not have AppArmor profiles loaded

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<unconfined>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<unconfined> will use netstat(8) to determine which processes have open
network sockets and do not have AppArmor profiles loaded into the kernel.

=head1 BUGS

B<unconfined> must be run as root to retrieve the process executable
link from the F</proc> filesystem. This program is susceptible to race
conditions of several flavours: an unlinked executable will be mishandled;
an executable started before a AppArmor profile is loaded will not
appear in the output, despite running without confinement; a process that dies
between the netstat(8) and further checks will be mishandled. This
program only lists processes using TCP and UDP. In short, this
program is unsuitable for forensics use and is provided only as an aid
to profiling all network-accessible processes in the lab.
