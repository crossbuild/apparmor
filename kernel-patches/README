For each kernel release there is a directory named using the kernel version #

The files managed by svn in a release directory are:

patches/ - directory of kernel patches without the apparmor module in the
          series.  These are used to build the apparmor.patch and
          apparmor-fullseries.patch
postapply/ - directory of patches to the module code in head of svn enabling
             it to build for a given kernel.
  current/ - patches against current branch
  nextgen/ - patches against nextgen branch


when a release tar ball is built it will be automatically generated using
the tip of module and module-nextgen and the release dir in the tar ball
will be populated with:

kernel version #
  current/ - contains the patches for the current branch of apparmor
    apparmor-Kversion#-svnversion#-fullseries.patch - single kernel patcch
    patches/ - quilt series to patch kernel including apparmor patch

  nextgen - contains the patches for the nextgen branch of apparmor
    apparmor-Kversion#-svnversion#-fullseries.patch - single kernel patch
    patches/ - quilt series to patch kernel including apparmor patch

the fullseries kernel patches are equivalent to the quilt series flattened
into a single patch
