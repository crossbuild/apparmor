inode_setattr hook
==================

* Reiserfs uses private directories and files for storing xattrs.
  It should set ATTR_FORCE when changing attributes on these
  files and directories with notify_change(). This may save us
  from constructing temporary struct path objects there.

* AppArmor should check for ATTR_FORCE in its inode_setattr hook,
  and should not log or deny ATTR_FORCE setattrs. SELinux does
  that already as well.
