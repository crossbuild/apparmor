  README 		- This file.

  subdomain_parser	- This program loads the subdomain database into
			  the kernel via the sysctl(2) interface.
  subdomain.5		- Man page explaining the structure of the
			  subdomain profile file.
  change_hat.2		- Man page explaining the usage of the change_hat
			  syscall.

subdomain_parser takes all of its input from STDIN.  Thus, if you want to
use it to load a description file, you want to do something like:

	./subdomain_parser < /path/to/database/file

Of course, you can use cat, etc. to load the contents of multiple files at
the same time.

subdomain_parser allows you to add, replace, and remove definitions
through the use of command line options. The default is to add.
`subdomain_parser --help` shows what the command line options are.

Please send all complaints, bug reports, feature requests, rants about the
software, and questions to apparmor-general@forge.novell.com. Security
issues should be directed to security@suse.de or secure@novell.com,
where we will attempt to conform to the RFP vulnerability disclosure

The parser uses the PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expression) engine,
which was written by Philip Hazel and is copyright by the University
of Cambridge, England. For more information on the PCRE engine, see
