The apparmor_parser allows you to add, replace, and remove AppArmor
policy through the use of command line options. The default is to add.
`apparmor_parser --help` shows what the command line options are.

You can also find more information at
<http://forge.novell.com/modules/xfmod/project/?apparmor>.

Please send all complaints, bug reports, feature requests, rants about the
software, and questions to apparmor-general@forge.novell.com. Security
issues should be directed to security@suse.de or secure@novell.com,
where we will attempt to conform to the RFP vulnerability disclosure
protocol: http://www.wiretrip.net/rfp/policy.html

The parser uses the PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expression) engine,
which was written by Philip Hazel and is copyright by the University
of Cambridge, England. For more information on the PCRE engine, see

Thanks.
