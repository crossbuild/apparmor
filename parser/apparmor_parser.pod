=head1 NAME

apparmor_parser - loads AppArmor profiles into the kernel

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<apparmor_parser [-adrR] [--add] [--debug]  [--replace] [--remove]
                  [--preprocess] [--Include n] [--base n] [ --Complain ]>

B<apparmor_parser [-hv] [--help] [--version]>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<apparmor_parser> is used to import new apparmor.d(5) profiles
into the Linux kernel. The profiles restrict the operations available
to processes by executable name.

The profiles are loaded into the Linux kernel by the B<apparmor_parser>
program, which takes its input from standard input. The input supplied to
B<apparmor_parser> should be in the format described in apparmor.d(5).

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item -a, --add

Insert the AppArmor definitions given into the kernel. This is the default
action. This gives an error message if a AppArmor definition by the same
name already exists in the kernel, or if the parser doesn't understand
its input. It reports when an addition succeeded.

=item -r, --replace

This flag is required if an AppArmor definition by the same name already
exists in the kernel; used to replace the definition already
in the kernel with the definition given on standard input.

=item -R, --remove

This flag is used to remove an AppArmor definition already in the kernel.
Note that it still requires a complete AppArmor definition as described
in apparmor.d(5) even though the contents of the definition aren't
used.

=item -p, --preprocess

Parse the profile(s) and process include directives and output the
result to stdout.

=item -I n, --Include n

Add element n to the search path when resolving #include directives
defined as an absolute paths.

=item -b n, --base n

Set the base directory for resolving #include directives
defined as relative paths.

=item -C, --Complain

Load the profile in complain mode.

=item -h, --help

Give a quick reference guide.

=item -v, --version

Print the version number and exit.

=item -d, --debug

Given once, only checks the profiles to ensure syntactic correctness.
Given twice, dumps its interpretation of the profile for checking.
