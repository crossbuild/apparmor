#
#	This is the codomain description file. 
#
#	Codomain descriptions should be of the following format:
#
#	Commented lines begin with #
#
# /path/program_name	{
# /path/resource	access_mode  	digital_signature_if_exe
# /path/resource	access_mode  	digital_signature_if_exe
# /path/resource	access_mode 	digital_signature_if_exe
#  }
#
#	Access modes consist of four possible entries: r(ead), w(rite),
#	x(ecute) and i(nherit) (which is the default anyway).
#
#	A really limited lame form of name_globbing exists: Any
#	description with a * will match anything following it. E.g.
#	a resource of "/foo/bar*  r" will grant read access to the
#	following:
#		/foo/barnyard_animals.gif
#		/foo/barf/baz/biff/blah
#	The exception: it will not match things that contain /../ so it
#	will not match
#		/foo/bar/../../etc/passwd
#	This should be improved/made slightly more sophisticated.
#
#	For subdomains, define a codomain for the main program (a
#	default), then define subdomains in the form of:
#		/path/to/program^subdomain_ident { \n  .... }
#	with resources on subsequent lines.
#
#	microbenchmarks for subdomain
#
#	Attempt to use md5sum as a prefetching microbenchmark. Sadly, it
#	didn't work.
