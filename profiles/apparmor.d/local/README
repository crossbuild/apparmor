This directory is intended to contain profile additions and overrides for
inclusion by distributed profiles to aid in packaging AppArmor for
distributions. While the shipped profiles in /etc/apparmor.d can still be
modified by an administrator, adjusting them here ensures that the package
manager of the distribution won't interfere with local modifications.

For example, if the shipped /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.smbd profile has:
#include <local/usr.sbin.smbd>

then an administrator can adjust /etc/apparmor.d/local/usr.sbin.smbd to
contain any additional paths to be allowed, such as:

  /var/exports/** lrw,

Keep in mind that 'deny' rules are evaluated after allow rules, so you won't be
able to allow access to files that are explicitly denied by the shipped profile
using this mechanism.
