The profiles in this directory are not turned on by default because they
are not as mature as the profiles in /etc/apparmor.d/.

In some cases, it is because the profile hasn't been updated to work
with newer code; in other cases, it because any benefit provided by the
profile is much less than the potential for causing problems.

In short, feel free to try these profiles if you wish, but be aware that
they may not work on default configurations, let alone your specific
configuration.

Feedback on these is welcomed; any contributions for this directory
should be clearly licensed -- we recommend using the GPL. Please mail
suggestions or modifications to the apparmor-general@forge.novell.com
mail list: http://forge.novell.com/mailman/listinfo/apparmor-general

Thanks
