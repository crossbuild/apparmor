#=DESCRIPTION 
# Verify ptrace.  The tracing process (attacher or parent of ptrace_me) may 
# not be confined.

# Disabled tests:
# Tests 3b and 4b
# Read permission was required for a confined process to be able to be traced 
# using ptrace.  This stopped being required or functioning correctly 
# somewhere between 2.4.18 and 2.4.20.
#
# Tests 10 and 11
# Requires a patch which prevents confined traced task from attempting exec.
# Unsure of usefulness of this.  We are concerned about confined task being
# the tracer not the tracee

# 1. unconfined parent, unconfined child, parent attaches		PASS
